<p>This essay re-examines the idea that God created a mature (i.e. old looking) creation, including fossils in the ground. This idea was famously held by Philip Henry Gosse (a nineteenth century Fellow of the Royal Society) and Francois Chateaubriand (a leading nineteenth century French writer). More recently, Dr Peter Nelson has published an excellent paper advocating a strong view of mature creation. &nbsp;This essay argues that maybe God created fossils in the ground, and addresses two points in greater philosophical and theological depth than appear in Dr Nelson&rsquo;s more technical paper:</p>

<ul>
<li>isn&rsquo;t this against God&rsquo;s character?</li>
<li>isn&rsquo;t this speculative?&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<div>
<p><strong>1. Isn&rsquo;t this against God's character?</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<em>1.1 &nbsp; Mature (i.e. old-looking) creation</em></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>There are two reasons for thinking that God created the world looking old. Firstly, why did God create the world at all? It was to be a picture of "his eternal power and divine nature" (Rom 1.20). The Sun's power reminds us of God's power, the body's intricacy of his wisdom, and the apparent age of the mountains reminds us of God's eternity (see Ps 90:2, Gen 49:26).&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Secondly, creating apparent age was useful and loving to man. Man's original job was to manage God's perfect creation. If Adam hadn't sinned, he would have continued as God's manager through billions of years (indeed forever) without dying. Adam's responsibilities included making decisions (e.g. where to dig irrigation channels) that affect the landscape for billions of years to come. If the original creation included beautiful mature mountains which were realistically typical of all the future mountains that would be deposited during Adam's multi-billion year stewardship, then examining those mountains would help Adam plan his work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<em>1.2 &nbsp; Creating "dead" animals</em></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Jesus took a few fish and multiplied them to feed over 5000 people. Anyone who didn't know what Jesus had done and just looked at the physical evidence would have thought that thousands of fish had earlier swum in the lake. Not only so - if Jesus&rsquo; miraculous fish, bread and wine were fully realistic, then they would have included millions of microfossils of dead wine yeast, dead bacteria in fish stomachs, etc.. Creating "dead" creatures which never really lived cannot be against God's character if Jesus did it. &nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<em>1.3 &nbsp; But WHY would God create fossils?</em></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>God does many things we can't understand. Just because we can&rsquo;t see why doesn&rsquo;t prove that God didn&rsquo;t do something! But we can give two tentative theories about why God might have created fossils in the rocks:</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1.3.1 &nbsp; Effect of the Fall</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>When Adam fell, it was no longer appropriate that he should look upon and touch perfect things in the garden of Eden, so he was sent out. Also, trillions of things throughout creation instantly or rapidly changed (e.g. stings were inserted into scorpions). Somebody who didn't know about the Fall and examined a scorpion that morning might find a realistically mature sting, and think it had been growing for months. The same principle carries over into the geological column. Before the Fall, the geological column of the realistically mature mountains likely included fossil trees, fruit, etc.. But after the Fall, it was no longer appropriate that man should touch and look upon perfect fruit in the geological column any more than in the Garden of Eden. Thus, plausibly (we don't know for sure), the Fall may have led God to mar the geological column making it redolent of a fallen world, just as he marred scorpions bodies to contain stings, and marred the stars so that they emit x-rays harmful to human beings.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1.3.2 &nbsp; Visualise God's just hatred of sin</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>God's creation contained visual reminders of his love, wisdom and power - did it also reveal his just hatred of sin?&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>God considers it very important to display his just hatred of sin. Romans 9.22 tells us that one of God&rsquo;s top motives for ruling history the way he does is to display his just hatred of sin more impressively.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>In the future new creation, believers will have visual reminders of God's just hatred of sin as they watch the damned being punished (Rev 19.1-5). This helps them to meditate on God's character. Perfect creatures (such as angels) find it very helpful to see visual reminders of God's just hatred of sin. This fact makes it plausible that the original creation may have included visual reminders of God&rsquo;s just hatred of sin.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>But what visual reminders could the original creation contain of God's just hatred of sin? Before the Fall, the Sun never scorched. There were probably no hurricanes, earthquakes or volcanoes. Given that God's just hatred of sin was then mainly expressed by his threat of death if man sinned, images of dead creatures in the rocks would seem very suitable.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>So, we may imagine Adam cracking open a stone, finding a fossil, and saying to himself, "how wonderful that creation has so many pictures of God's character - his love, wisdom, power and even his hatred of sin". We don't know whether or not God put fossils in the rocks (the Bible doesn&rsquo;t say, so we just don&rsquo;t know), but there&rsquo;s no obvious reason why it would be against God&rsquo;s character.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Imagine that the UN votes to set up a new country with a low population in a remote desert. Even before any crimes have been committed, a prudent government will set apart a courthouse, and display on it symbols of its threatened justice (such as the traditional drawn sword). When the innocent citizens see these symbols, they will rejoice and say "how good that our government promises to be fair". Similarly, it is hard to see why including visual reminders in creation of God's hatred of sin would be against his character.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<em>1.3 &nbsp; Is God a Deceiver?</em></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Even if God put fossils in the ground, he wouldn't be a Deceiver. This is obvious both by common sense and from the Bible. If a museum curator displays a helmet that looks old and Roman to make an educational point, but attaches a clear label saying "I made this last week", no sensible person accuses him of deception. God has given us abundant evidence that the Bible is his word, and that tells us that the world is only a few thousand years old. If God made it look old as a visual reminder of his eternity (see Rom 1.20), or included fossils as visual reminders of his hatred of sin, then there is no deception - the label is clear!</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Also, Scripture teaches that God does deliberately mislead people. This is not the same as lying. Lying means stating things that are untrue. The Bible is God&rsquo;s word and nothing in the Bible is untrue. God cannot lie. But the Bible says that God can and does deliberately set up circumstances to punish people who ignore him by leading them into even greater error. The Bible has many examples of this (2 Thess 2:11-12, 1 Kings 22:19-23, 2 Kings 3:22-24, etc., etc.). Probably the most famous is Jesus&rsquo; parables. Rather than telling his opponents the message straightforwardly, Jesus deliberately spoke in enigmatic parables, on purpose (see Mark 4:11-12) &nbsp;to make their hard hearts even harder, so that they would get the wrong impression that Jesus was just a storyteller. Jesus never lied, but he did deliberately set things up so that those who rejected him fell into even greater error.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Psalm 19 shows us that although creation and scripture both reveal God, his revelation in Scripture is clearer and richer than his revelation in creation. Even within Scripture, God is most clearly and wonderfully revealed in Jesus Christ. If Jesus&rsquo; own teaching contains elements which are deliberately intended to lead hard hearted people further into error, then how much more might creation (less clear and less important to God&rsquo;s overall revelation) contain such elements too! Given this, it is perfectly plausible that God set up creation and governed history such that those who refuse to accept his word that the world is a few thousand years old fall into ever greater error.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>&nbsp;<br /><strong>2. Isn&rsquo;t this speculative?</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Speculation means making guesses about things which God hasn't revealed in the Bible. The Bible doesn't tell us whether or not fossils were there when God first made the world. There is no clear reason why it would be against God's character to make fossils to reveal his hatred of sin, to mar the geological column after the Fall, or indeed for some other unknown reason. We just don&rsquo;t know. A speculator is someone who expresses a definite view on a question where God hasn't revealed the answer (e.g. by saying "God certainly didn't put fossils in the rocks"). The humble, modest person says "maybe - I just don&rsquo;t know".</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The book of Job lays huge emphasis on the mystery of creation. Man doesn't know how God made the world - that is part of what makes God separate, holy and different to us. God asks (Job 38:4), "where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth?" - and that question pervades the whole of Job. &nbsp;Neither the "Scientific Creationist" nor the Christian Old Earther takes this mystery seriously enough. "Where were you?", asks God. "I wasn't actually there", replies the Scientific Creationist, "but using my Catastrophic Plate Tectonics model, I can figure out how God set up the inside of the earth in the first few days, and how he switched on Noah's flood". "Where were you?", asks God. "I wasn't actually there", replies the Christian Old Earther, "but using radiotelescopes and back projections of physical formulae, I can work out the fundamental forces of the Universe a fraction of microsecond after God set it all off!" The problem with both positions should be obvious. The truth is rather that "God has put eternity into man's heart, yet so that he cannot find out what God has done from the beginning to the end" (Eccl 3:11). &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>3. Implications</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>We have argued that maybe God put fossils in the ground. If this is even a valid possibility, it radically affects how "Scientific Creationists", and other advocates of the Bible should go about their business. We just don't know whether fossils were made with the world, added to mar the rocks after the Fall (as Dr. Nelson plausibly suggests), deposited in the Flood (as "Scientific Creationists" maintain), or formed by some other unknown and mysterious process. We just don&rsquo;t know. We would do well to spend more time adoring God's mystery, and less claiming that we know how he made the world (beyond what is revealed in Scripture). Truly, he is the God who "destroys the wisdom of the wise" (1 Cor 1.19) and hides his great truths from the wise and learned but reveals them to little children (see Matt 11.25).</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>&nbsp;<br />Finally, we should note how persuasive the evidence for Christianity is. It would be fair to say that the interface with geology is probably the single weakest point of the whole Christian system. Frankly, if this is the weakest point, that shows what a good system it is!! That's why the New Atheists concentrate their attacks here. You won't hear them talk so much about supposed contradictions in the Bible or debunking Jesus' resurrection, because on these points they have so little to say! Yet even looking at creation, it is clear that the world is vastly unlikely to have come about by chance and hence atheism does not really stack up. &nbsp;(See Prof. John Lennox and Prof. William Lane Craig on this point). If the only evidence we had to go on in creation was the fossils, perhaps we might disbelieve Christianity. Likewise, if the only part of Jesus' ministry was his parables, perhaps we might conclude with the Pharisees that he was just a good storyteller. But taking Jesus' ministry as a whole, the evidence shows overwhelmingly that Jesus was God's Son who (as one might expect) sometimes spoke enigmatically. Similarly, creation as a whole testifies clearly that it is designed, but (naturally given that it was made by God), it also contains some deliberate mysteries.&nbsp;</p>
